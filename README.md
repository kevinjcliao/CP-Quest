# CP Quest: 

CP Quest is a simple, modular console based text RPG for prospective customs people in Haverford College. 

## About the Customs Program: 
Haverford College is unique in the way that we approach freshman orientation. Rather than employ RAs to police the halls, the college has created a program called Customs, designed to train upperclassmen to live on the hall and foster a hall dynamic that is often compared to a family. Rather than see their RAs as authority figures, students see Customs People or CPs as mentors and friends. This kind of relationship builds a hall that becomes more than a place to live, but also a home to return to. CPs receive no compensation for their work, but the application process is highly competitive, illustrating the immense amount of respect for the program. 

## About CPQuest: 
This application is written in Python. It is object oriented from the ground up. Different responses are available to the user based on the previous choices that they make.
